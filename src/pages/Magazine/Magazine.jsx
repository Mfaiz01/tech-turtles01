    Why always a boy kid not a girl? There is a vast discrimination between a girl and
a boy. India being a developing nation is still not yet able to abolish this
discrimination since centuries, we Indians flying with our 77th independence but
the people’s mindset is still in 50s. We have only achieved independence only in
point of getting freedom from British but not in state to thrive out of the
boundaries that we have created around us like caste, creed, race etc.
Boundaries makes a huge sense where through this we can develop our nation
and even make it work. Being educated we still stick on to such unnecessary
discrimination among ourselves. Discrimination is just a illusionary world, just
peep out of this fake world then we can a view of beautiful world where we all are
one against all odds.
Women is a powerful divine soul who can create anything and destroy everything. Women have equal rights as men, never ever degrade her. She is not a toy of men
every holy book describes her. She is not bounded only to the four walls of
kitchen. She has all her rights to build her future as per her visions. You are no
one to stop her “It’s her life” "Behind every successful man there is a woman" this
is a known fact. If you once stand by her side and support. Her. She is the one
who let you fall lifelong what women expects? Nothing just to like a human and to
respect her. She is the one who protects you in each stage of your life a mother,
as a wife and she is the one who makes your life colourful as a daughter. Let her
fly, she is not a caged bird and fine day she well makes you proud beyond your
expectations.
The great challenge of present generation is to reveal the small world that is
hidden belonid this illusionary world in which we are surviving yet. The new world
we are yet to reveal has the power to change our developing nation into the
developed one equality is not forsake mentioned in the constitution it is to follow
and to build a better world wear looking ahead change is not required to the
nation it is required to the mindsets of people living here. Break all the add
boundaries around you respect you one another and lead your life peacefully you
never know the fate of tomorrow.

Human Brain- A Wonder

Human brain is a miracle, indeed, still mysterious, and much more to be
discovered yet. The idea that the brain is like a muscle that grows with exercise is
not just a metaphor. I read a case which caught my eye. A case of a woman named
CHERYL SCHILTZ. Cheryl feels like she’s endlessly falling. When she stands up
without support, she looks as if she were standing on the tip of a cliff and about to
drop down. Soon her whole body is moving chaotically back and forth, and she
looks like a person walking a tightrope before losing balance. She doesn’t look like
she is only afraid of falling, more like she’s afraid of being pushed. For Cheryl,
there is no peace, even after she’s fallen to the floor. There have been times when
she literally loses sense of the floor and still feels like she’s falling perpetually to
an infinite black hole.
Cheryl’s problem is that her Vestibular Apparatus, the sensory organ for the
balance system, isn’t working. All she suffered just because of an antibiotic
“GENTAMICIN”, used to treat infections, which was given way beyond the limit,
damaging her balance organ. Vestibular Apparatus has three semicircular canals in
the inner ear. The semicircular canals contain little hairs in a fluid bath. When we
move our head, the fluid stirs the hair, which sends a signal to our brain telling us
that we have increased our velocity in a particular direction. A example that how
vestibular apparatus assists us is, when you run after a bus, with your head
bouncing up and down, you are able to keep that moving bus at the center of your
gaze because your vestibular apparatus sends message to your brain, telling it the
speed and direction in which you are running to maintain balance of body.
Cheryl’s case was a hopeless one. At that time a great neuroscientist came up with
a prototype challenging this problem. An instrument which looked like a
construction hat with holes on the sides and a device installed in it called
Accelerometer. Licking a thin plastic strip with small electrodes on it, she places it
on her tongue. After all arrangements, strip on tongue releases Champagne into
the mouth stimulating nerves of the tongue to carry signals to the brain. Quite
complicated, isn’t it? Following the stimulation for two minutes, the feeling of
endless falling left for her for the first time in five years.
After this success, there have been theories about how the brain functions and
how flexible it is. A true wonder. Neuroscientists gave their explanations that the
brain is made of many neural pathways, or neurons that are connected to one
another and working together. If certain key pathways are blocked, then the brain
uses older pathways to go around them. The signals to the vestibular apparatus
ceased, but the brain uses other pathways to reach it by external stimulation. Not
a direct, but an indirect one. It’s just like how we use other roads or routes while
traveling, when the main road is blocked. Those indirect pathways can be called
“Secondary” neural pathways. By stimulating externally, the “Secondary” neural
pathways are exposed. If the stimulation is practiced daily,
the “Secondary” pathways get much stronger and adopted.
The brain is a far more open system than we ever imagined,
nature has gone very far to help us with this brain
plasticity. We are gifted with a brain that survives in
changing the world by changing itself.

Mental Health: A Universal Human Right

Mental health is a crucial aspect of our overall well-being. It refers to our
emotional state of mind, cognitive, behavioral, psychological, and social
wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel, and act. Good mental health is vital for
leading a healthy and fulfilling life. The mental health problems can range from
mild to severe, which is experienced differently from one person to the next and
can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background, with varying degrees
of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical
outcomes. Some common mental health disorders include anxiety, depression,
bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Mental health problems are prevalent in
today's world. However, it is often overlooked by many people.
According to the study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and
Neurosciences (NIMHANS), one in five Indians suffers from some form of mental
illness. The study also found that the prevalence of mental illness was higher
Mental Health: A Universal Human Right
among the urban middle class. In India,
the issue of mental health among
students has been gaining attention in
recent years. According to a survey
conducted by the Indian Council of
Medical Research (ICMR), 12-13% of
students in India suffer from
psychological, emotional, and behavioral
conditions. The Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown have further exacerbated the
situation. According to a study published in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry, over
53% of Indian university students suffer from moderate to extremely severe
depression. Academic institutions in India have a responsibility to raise
awareness about mental health issues among students. They can do this by
providing access to counseling services and support groups that can provide the
necessary assistance. Additionally, academic institutions can set up support
groups to offer urgent aid to students in need. There are many
misconceptions about mental health. Here are some of the most
common ones:
1. Mental health problems are uncommon: In reality, mental
health problems are quite common. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), one in four people in the world will
be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.
2. Mental illness is a sign of weakness: Mental illness is not a sign of weakness. It
is a medical condition that requires treatment, just like any other illness.
3. People with mental illness are violent and dangerous: This is a harmful
stereotype that is not true. Most people with mental illness are not violent and
are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.
4. Mental illness is caused by personal weakness or character flaws: Mental
illness is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, biological, environmental, and
social factors.
5. Mental illness cannot be treated: This is not true. Mental illness can be treated
effectively with medication, therapy, or a combination of both.
6. Mental health problems only affect certain types of people: Mental health
problems can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or socioeconomic
status.
It's important to break down these misconceptions and
promote accurate information about mental health. By
doing so, we can reduce the stigma surrounding mental
illness and encourage people to seek help when they need
it. It is essential to recognize the importance of mental
health and take steps to maintain it. It’s important to
recognize the early signs of mental health problems and
seek professional help if necessary. Some common signs include changes in
mood, behavior, or sleep patterns. There are many ways to promote good mental
health. These include regular exercise, healthy eating habits, getting enough
sleep, and practicing mindfulness. Additionally, it’s important to have a strong
support system of family and friends who can provide emotional support when
needed.
If you know someone who is struggling with a mental illness,
there are several ways you can help them:
1. Listen: One of the most important things you can do is to
listen to them without judgment. Let them know that you are
there for them and that you care about their well-being.
2. Educate yourself: Learn more about the mental illness they
are dealing with. This can help you 2. understand what they are going through and
how you can support them.
3. Offer practical help: Offer to help them with everyday tasks such as cooking,
cleaning, or running errands. This can be especially helpful if they are going
through a difficult time.
45. 46.
4. Encourage them to seek professional help: Encourage them to seek
professional help if they haven't already done so. You can offer to help them find
a therapist or other mental health professional.
5. Take care of yourself: Supporting someone with a mental illness can be
challenging, so it's essential to take care of yourself too. Make sure you are
getting enough rest, eating well, and taking time for yourself.
Remember that recovery from mental illness is possible
with the right treatment and support. By being there for
your loved one, you can make a significant difference in
their life. Remember that taking care of your mental health
is just as important as taking care of your physical health.
By prioritizing your mental well-being, you can lead a
happier and more fulfilling life. Mental health is more than
the absence of mental disorder. There are several
resources available such as counseling services and
support groups that can provide the necessary assistance.

          5. Mental illness cannot be treated: This is not true. Mental illness can be treated
          effectively with medication, therapy, or a combination of both.
          6. Mental health problems only affect certain types of people: Mental health
          problems can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or socioeconomic
          status.<br /><br />
          It's important to break down these misconceptions and

          If you know someone who is struggling with a mental illness,
          there are several ways you can help them:
          1. Listen: One of the most important things you can do is to
          listen to them without judgment. Let them know that you are
          there for them and that you care about their well-being.<br /><br />
          2. Educate yourself: Learn more about the mental illness they
          are dealing with. This can help you 2. understand what they are going through and
          how you can support them.<br /><br />
          3. Offer practical help: Offer to help them with everyday tasks such as cooking,
          cleaning, or running errands. This can be especially helpful if they are going
          through a difficult time.<br /><br />
          4. Encourage them to seek professional help: Encourage them to seek
          professional help if they haven't already done so. You can offer to help them find
          a therapist or other mental health professional.<br /><br />
          5. Take care of yourself: Supporting someone with a mental illness can be
          challenging, so it's essential to take care of yourself too. Make sure you are
          getting enough rest, eating well, and taking time for yourself.<br /><br />
          Remember that recovery from mental illness is possible
          with the right treatment and support. By being there for
          your loved one, you can make a significant difference in
          their life. Remember that taking care of your mental health
          is just as important as taking care of your physical health.
